# CRC16
This contains a general code to implement the CRC16 algorithms such as 
  1. CRC-16/AUG-CCITT
  2. CRC-16/BUYPASS
  3. CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE
  4. CRC-16/CDMA2000
  5. CRC-16/DDS-100
  6. CRC-16/DECT-X
  7. CRC-16/T10-DIF
  8. CRC-16/TELEDISK
  9. CRC-16/XMODEM

To try this code, we can just uncomment your chosen algorithm and comment remaining definitions.
